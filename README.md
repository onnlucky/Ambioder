Ambioder 2
====

Reprogram Ikea's Dioder, based on http://gabriel-lg.github.io/Ambioder/
(My brothers project). But a very different approach, so that there is
space to bring back ikea's buttons and color wheel as well.


build and run
----

Require gputils (http://gputils.sourceforge.net/) for gpasm and gplink. And make.

Require gpsim (http://gpsim.sourceforge.net/) to run simulator.

```
$ make
$ make run
```

`pulse.stc` drives the sim, it will simulate 0.1 second of running.
